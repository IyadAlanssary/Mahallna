# Mahallna

Mahallna is an E-commerce mobile app that connects people who have products that are about to expire with people who need them.

## Features

- Browse products by name, category or expiration date
- Post your own products.
- Rate and comment on the products you interact with.
- The closer the products get to their expiration date, the lower their price becomes. The seller decides how much the price drops by percentage.
- Manage your profile
